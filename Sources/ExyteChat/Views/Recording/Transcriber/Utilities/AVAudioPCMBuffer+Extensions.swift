    /// This method efficiently computes the RMS value using Apple's Accelerate framework,
    /// which provides high-performance vector-based calculations. The implementation:
    /// 1. Squares all samples using vDSP_vsq
    /// 2. Sums the squared values using vDSP_sve
    /// 3. Averages across all channels
    /// 4. Takes the square root for final RMS value
    ///
    /// Performance considerations:
    /// - Uses Accelerate's SIMD operations for vectorized math
    /// - Processes all channels in parallel
    /// - Minimizes memory allocation by reusing a temporary buffer
    /// - Significantly faster than manual loop-based calculation
    ///
    /// - Returns: A Float value between 0 and 1 representing the RMS power of the audio
    ///           Returns 0 if the buffer has no valid channel data
